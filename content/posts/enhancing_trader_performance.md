### Chapter 1: Where Expertise Begins

Vince Lombardi once commented that good losers usually lose. So it was with Mick and Al.
 

───

Practice is the cornerstone of expertise because it multiplies experience.
 

───

How many years’ worth of market data has Scott seen in his relatively few years of trading? How many years’ worth of experience is lost by traders during their periods of emotional outbursts, breaks from the screen, and days off?
 

───

The essence of deliberative practice is what I call the learning loop. A learning loop is an attempted performance, followed by specific feedback about the success/failure of the performance, followed by renewed efforts that incorporate the feedback (see Exhibit 1.1)
 

───

Next to the leave-everything-on-the-mat work ethic of a Dan Gable, the effort of maintaining a trading journal hardly requires a laboring instinct. Yet the majority of traders won’t sustain even this level of performance commitment. Why is that?
 

───

Ironically, part of the problem is that new traders themselves view trading as a kind of antiperformance activity. Because they see young people seemingly no different from themselves succeed in the markets, they assume they can do it, too. One trader I worked with was losing day after day and began to fear that his firm would fire him. “I don’t want that to happen,” he explained. “I want to be a trader. I don’t want to have to work for someone else 9 to 5.”

There it was.

This was not a trader who was drawn to markets the way Gable fiercely embraced wrestling or Jordan pursued basketball. He wanted to trade because he didn’t like the alternatives. The alternatives meant eight hours a day of effort and the loss of the freedom to do what he wanted to do. But elite performers are doing what they want to do when they labor far more than eight hours a day on their craft. 
 

───

Without an intrinsic love for the performance activity itself, no one can sustain Galton’s laboring instinct to “fret and strive” and overcome barriers to success.
 

───

We often talk about expertise as if it’s a quality that one possesses. One person is an expert; another is not. Such talk makes it sound as though expertise is an all-or-none thing. Research tells us, however, that expertise is a process—one that unfolds over a considerable period of time. 
 

───

Most important of all, Bloom’s work underscores that the achievement of elite performance cannot begin with the hard-core pursuit of mastery. It begins with the simple process of exploration: encountering a field, having fun with it, and seeing if it truly speaks to you.


───

This insight may seem commonsensical, but it is rarely acknowledged in the trading world.

When we think about developing trader expertise, we naturally focus on the final, mastery stage. We try to teach new traders the nuances of entries, exits, reading order flow, limiting losses, and mastering emotions. This seems quite reasonable at first blush, but is laughably backward from Bloom’s perspective. Why would we start traders on the final steps of a developmental process?

Think of it this way: Would we recommend that a young couple on a first date accelerate the mastery of their relationship by announcing an engagement?

In fact, there would be no better way to sabotage a fledgling relationship than to artificially accelerate its progression toward marriage. A couple faced with such pressure would rightfully protest that they need more time to learn about each other; they’re not ready for such a commitment.

But might that be true for traders as well? 
  

───

Bloom’s research supports such an analysis. He found that two factors were crucial to the earliest, initiation phase of performance development: (1) having fun and (2) obtaining support from the social environment. Without the initial fun factor, young persons never develop the interest to sustain them through the subsequent rigors of perfect practice. Part of the early enjoyment of the activity, no doubt, is the praise and attention received from family members, friends, and teachers. Another part is talent: It is difficult to imagine enjoying an activity for which one has little or no aptitude. The combination of early success and early encouragement provides the motivational impetus to continue the activity, which in turn fuels the drive for future development.
  

───

Even in the later phases of development, the fun factor remains an important motivational element.
  

───

Elite performers in those disciplines, however, routinely report loving the training process. Bloom’s insight is that they didn’t start out that way. This is because with performance, as with relationships, the developmental process is one in which extrinsic and hedonistic motivations are gradually transformed into intrinsic, effortful ones. Building skills while having fun is transformed into an enjoyment of skill building for its own sake.
  

───

Performance, like relationships, begins with a positive chemistry between performer and performance field
  

───

To develop expertise as a trader, the imposition of discipline and deliberative practice is not the first step to be taken. The first step—and the one so often forgotten by new traders—is to simply have fun.
  

───

When the conversation turned to longevity in the trading field, Linda remarked, “Experience counts for so much.” It’s not that she makes money every month—in fact, she mentioned that much of her profit may come from a couple of very good months out of the year. She says of her performance, however, “I know the cycles.” She knows there will be lean times as well as good ones. 
  

───

At the end of their research project, Bloom and his colleagues found that three factors distinguish high-level performance across the various fields they studied:

1. Strong interest and emotional commitment to a particular field

2. Desire to reach a high level of attainment in the field

3. Willingness to put in the significant time and effort required for this high-level achievement
  

───

Our task, in the initial phase of development, is to forge an emotional bond so strong that it will survive the inevitable frustrations and opportunity costs of the learning curve.
  

───

To invest the great amounts of time and effort required for mastery, an individual must emotionally bond with the talent field, creating a long-term relationship.
  

───

The greats do not become great by working hard; they work hard because they find a great niche: a field that captures their talents, interests, and imagination.
  

───

Finding the right niche makes all the difference in the world when it comes to performance. A hall-of-fame baseball pitcher might well be a flop as a hitter; a punter in football rarely makes a good linebacker; commercial print models are not necessarily the ones who dominate the runway; the best medical researchers don’t always make the best teachers: Over and over we see examples where the difference between success and failure is being in the right niche. 
  

───

One does not become a top gun without some click between personality, abilities, and the challenges of being a fighter pilot.
 

───

Without exposure to different trading activities, traders are a bit like partners in an arranged marriage. Maybe the arrangement will be a good fit; maybe it will be a disaster. It probably won’t be fun. And, as Benjamin Bloom found out, it is difficult to sustain a commitment without that emotional bonding. How many traders never progress through the stages of mastery not because they’re lazy, but because they’re simply in the wrong place? If, even after a period of courtship and engagement, half of all marriages end in divorce, how can we expect to make better decisions about the markets we marry without so much as a few dates?
 

───

It’s not whether you can be a good trader; it’s whether you can find the trading that’s good for you.
 

───

Look, kid, don’t ever—ya understand me?—don’t ever let anyone monkey with your swing.

—Ted Williams to a young Carl Yastrzemski
 

───

We like to think of greatness as a function of an individual’s personal qualities, but reality is far more complex. It is the fit between the individual and the performance environment that generates expertise
 

───

So often, the difference between success and mediocrity is the difference from one performance setting to another. In one niche, an animal thrives; in another, it is threatened with extinction. Unlike animals, however, we can select our niches. We can find the environments that will nurture and expand our talents
